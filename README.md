# Get Focused

Get Focused is a Todo list app that focuses not on all the various tasks you need to do over the current day, week and the upcoming weeks but instead on the tasks you **need** to finish now. Get focused on the things you need to complete and don't bogged down in long lists with multiple buckets.
